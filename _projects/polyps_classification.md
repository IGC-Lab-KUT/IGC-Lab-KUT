Developed **DepthResNet**, a cross-platform GUI-based application for the **automatic classification of polyp images** by a **customized convolutional neural network named Depth-ResNet**. This project is made to assist medical professionals and researchers with fast and accurate identification of polyps from endoscopic images.

The core of the application is **Depth-ResNet**, a customized extension of the ResNet50 architecture, specifically customized to identify patterns and subtle features unique to polyp structures. This model was trained on a diverse dataset of labeled polyp images.

The trained model is integrated into a custom-built **GUI application** that works on both **Windows and Linux** systems. The interface allows users to load images, receive real-time classification results, and optionally model predictions with confidence scores or heatmaps.

> **Use Case**: Ideal for use in medical research labs, clinical screening tools, academic projects, and educational settings.

## Key Features

- **Depth-ResNet**: A custom deep learning model based on ResNet50, optimized for polyp classification.
- **Cross-platform GUI application** supporting both Windows and Linux systems.
- Real-time classification with optional confidence score.
- Built for **practical clinical and research integration**.
