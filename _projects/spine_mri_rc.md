I developed **MRI SEG Lite**, a lightweight version of the original MRI-SEG software package, specifically tailored for **resource-constrained environments** such as the **Raspberry Pi**. This version is designed to perform **automatic classification and segmentation of Spine MRI images** directly on edge devices without reliance on high-end GPUs or cloud infrastructure.

To make this possible, the original deep learning model was **converted and optimized** using techniques such as **model pruning, quantization**, and **format conversion** (e.g., TensorFlow Lite), significantly reducing memory and compute requirements while **preserving model accuracy** to a similar level of the original one.

MRI SEG Lite supports the same core functionalities as the desktop version, including real-time visualization, but is optimized for environments with **limited hardware resources and power constraints**. This makes it suitable for use in **remote clinics, field hospitals**, or **mobile diagnostic units**.
