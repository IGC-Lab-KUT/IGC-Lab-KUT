I developed **MRI-SEG**, a cross-platform software package for **automatic classification and segmentation of Spine MRI images**. The tool features a custom **GUI** designed for ease of use on both **Windows and Linux** systems. MRI-SEG integrates a **deep learning model** that I personally built and trained, enabling accurate segmentation and diagnosis support for spinal structures in MRI scans.

> **Data Source**: Spine MRI data was provided by **AIIMS Raebareli**, Department of Neurosurgery, under the guidance of **Dr. Suyash Singh**. This project was a **collaborative effort** between **NIT Meghalaya** and **AIIMS Raebareli**.

## Features

- **Custom-built deep learning architecture** for spine MRI segmentation.
- **GUI-based application** with real-time visualization and result output.
- Compatible with **Windows and Linux** platforms.
- Designed for **ease of integration** into clinical workflows and research settings.
